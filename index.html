          Fencing is a sport where two people (fencers) play tag with metal
          sticks (blades) on a 14m by 1.5m area (piste). Points are decided by a
          referee aided by a scoring box which is attached to the fencers’
          weapons through wires. The game is technically, mechanically,
          tactically, and strategically complex.

              Foil is often the first weapon a fencer will hold as it is the
              lightest and was originally intended to teach a fencer the key

              are scored by depressing the tip of the weapon on the opponent’s

              points based on whether a fencer touches their opponent anywhere
              on the body. It is the only weapon where there are no rules
              regarding a right to attack. It is the only weapon where both
              fencers can score a point at the same time due to there being no

          There are treatises written instructing European weapon based martial
          arts from around 1300. The sport was initially created for military
          training and by the mid-1700s had become an amateur and recreational
          sport. One figure who aided in this transition was
          <a class="link"

            target="_blank"

          and by 1896 official regulations were created ahead of the first
          summer Olympics that year.

          The sport’s inclusion in the Olympics is easily what has allowed the
          sport to grow into one with contenders and champions from all over the
          world with different backgrounds. Europe has always maintained a
          strong presence in the sport, most consistently has been Italy,
          France, and Hungary although pretty much anywhere in Europe, there is
          a presence. In the Americas, USA and Canada maintain long held
          strength although Venezuela has done extremely well in recent years.
          Cuba (much like Britain) have fallen off in more recent years. In
          Africa, Egypt has made huge strides over the past twenty years.
          Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and South Africa also maintain some presence
          in the sport. In Asia, Russia, China, Japan and South Korea have
          maintained a high level of fencing since the turn of the millenium.

          The sport is widespread as a result but remains relatively small in
          each country for a variety of reasons. The accessibility of the sport
          is limited as the it is expensive with most people only being exposed

    You should have a blade (epee, foil or sabre), a body-wire (body-cord
    if American), a mask, jacket, plastron, glove, breeches (knickers if
    American), and a breastplate should you have breasts to plate.
    The ESSENTIALS of these are the protective gear. Fencing has
    maintained a relatively

      >low injury rate</a
    >
    because of this protective equipment (most injuries tend to be caused
    by repetitive strain). Make sure you wear protective equipment and
    check that it has a badge showing how much protection it offers (usually 350 Newtons or 800 Newtons) or at
    least feels like you wouldn’t be able to puncture it with a blade.

            actions, strong balance with co-ordination and mind-games are all
            still there.

        <p class="text">
          The most important requirement (like almost any competitive sport) is
          other people to fence against. For most people, this means a club.
          Almost every club should have equipment and some way to onboard
          beginners without committing too much money to the sport initially. A
          club should ideally have a coach, other fencers, and enough equipment
          to fence with. There should be at least one box with working reels or
          transmitters.
