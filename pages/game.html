          It is entirely possible to have the perfect technique and conditioning
          for fencing but still be a worse fencer than your opponent because
          they understand the game better (the opposite can be true too, you can
          have all the knowledge and no ability to execute it). At a more
          general level, a lot of the game theory you can learn while fencing
          can be applied to other games where you are pitted against opponents.
          The concepts can be applied to chess, poker, fighting games,
          first-person shooters and any combat sport.

            This cognitive model proposes that decisions begin with making an Observation,

          This is a model developed for decision making by American military aircraft 
          pilot John Boyd. It is called the OODA Loop. The model is for realtime 
          competition and the basic theory is that between competitors, those who 
          can go through this cognitive loop fastest and more often are more likely to win.
          Being able to disrupt opponents' OODA Loops can lead to yours being ahead. It 
          has been applied to succeed in <a class="link"

          battle strategy, business and political campaigns</a>. The 
          ability to lead and have your opponent be a step behind is key to victory 
          in any competition. It makes taking back initiative more work and skews 
          the odds in your favour as they will need to predict to gain an upper-hand.

          The objective of the game is to hit the opponent without getting hit
          yourself. There is pretty much only ever 3 things you can do while
          fencing or playing a similar game. You can wait to see what your
          opponent will do and react to whatever they do (counter attack), you can try to build
          up an advantage over your opponent (preperation, then attack) or you can try to interrupt your
          opponent’s build-up (attack on preperation). There is a rock paper scissors relationship
          between these options.

          As you might expect, there is a lot more to these games than pure RPS.
          One can consider their own strengths and weaknesses as well as their
          opponent’s. If your opponent has a rough time reacting to your
          actions, you can do straightforward actions more freely without fear
          of punishment. If your opponent is good at building-up to complete an
          attack, you should try to make it as difficult as possible for them to
          be in a situation where they can build an attack on you. This could be
          by interrupting their attack with actions like a beat to the blade, or
          a convincing feint (if you’re really confident and have the right
          distance, just go straight on them). A good example of this is in a
          bout between Timur Safin and Richard Kruse.

          >
          placed earlier in Safin's build-up. Basically, do stuff the annoys
          your opponent and stuff that prevents them from annoying you.

          the athleticism of epee fencing has increased to a point where doing
          nothing can be risky when your opponent can explode into an attack
          which you can't defend.

          If you know what your opponent wants to do and your opponent knows
          what you want to do, how do you hit them and how do they hit you? The

          People naturally make mistakes; good fencers make fewer and less
          egregious ones (they are also REALLY good at punishing them). This is
          a result of experience, confidence, good coaching, and active
          attention being paid to improve one’s fencing. The kinds of mistakes a
          person makes are dependent on a number of factors. These include
          experience in competition, confidence, emotional state, how well they
          have slept, energy levels etc.

          Bluffing works by presenting your opponent with an intention and doing
          another instead. This could be moving your blade to your opponent's,
          showing that you want to parry while out of distance. Only to counter
          attack while your opponent tries to disengage from your action. It
          could be acting as if you are waiting and doing nothing, only to
          surprise your opponent with a sudden and explosive attack. Kruse
          attempts a bluff by showing that he wants to get the right to attack
          from Safin by trying to beat his blade, only then to attack directly

          wants to surprise him, or maybe he decided to slow down because he
          wasn’t certain of Kruse's intentions (decreasing the risk he takes).
          Perhaps Safin was looking for a response from Kruse and was bluffing
          his build-up to draw a response. If you can get your opponent to

          Tricks are kind of like bluffs, only that they involve your opponent
          not actively following your signal, but rather not noticing something
          you have done. If they register the trick, then they should be able to
          call it out in some way. This could be getting closer to your opponent
          than they realise by increasing the size of your steps but moving at
          the same speed.

          describes shifting bodyweight to create an illusion of distance in an
          MMA context. These tricks (and so many more) all somewhat fall under
          building up an attack. You need the time and space which allows you to
          set up these tricks. The distinction is fuzzy and probably changes
          depending on if the opponent is familiar with the tactics or not.

          Pattern recognition is noticing things that your opponent does

          fencer begins the start of every point by bringing their back leg up
          to their front leg to gain some extra distance. This could be punished
          with a far range attack as it is far more difficult to parry out while
          not in a squatted stance. One might notice their opponent consistently
          parries one way instead of another and punish them for this. One might
          notice their opponent retract their arm too far after an engagement
          and punish as their ability to attack and parry are

          An experienced fencer when facing a novice in a competition will often
          try 2 things. The first is to try and exploit some weakness that a
          novice may be expected to have. This could be that they do a parry
          incorrectly, overreact or can’t move as well as the

            experienced fencer</a
          >. The other, is just wait. They will still move around and act as if
          they are going to attack, but do not. This creates enormous pressure
          on the novice who may feel a need to do something and can cause them
          to have weaker judgement. Maybe attacking out of distance or trying to
          take the opponent’s blade when they should go straight on to the
          target. The fear that someone is better than you can be so great that
          it makes you worse.

          One fencer is being extremely defensively minded and is locked into
          what their opponent is doing, reacting to every blade action and step.
          The attacking realises this and gives them a host of feints which go
          to varying depths, jumps, steps, and half-steps. All these actions
          tire the defensive fencer’s nervous system and allows the attacking
          fencer to notice what is not being reacted to and attack with a simple
          feint, disengage from the parry and
