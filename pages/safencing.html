          It has quite a small group of fencers who compete at a national level.
          Entries for the largest national events go from 30-50 (senior men’s
          epee for example). Smaller events (senior women’s sabre and senior
          men’s sabre) can be from 6-12 people. Clubs vary in size but the
          largest can be found in Gauteng, the Western Cape and Limpopo. The
          amount of fencers per province and city is quite consistent with
          population spread across the country. This is a

              Club and coaching fees can go from R500 to R1500 per month. It is
              highly recommended that you get coaching if you are starting out (most
              places will not let you fence without having some coaching) as without
              it, it’s extremely difficult to build up the techniques.

              If you want to buy your own equipment, the situation in South Africa
              requires patience. There are limited options for vendors (<a class="link"

              >, probably the best prices locally but no listings for items plus
              shipping can vary. I have found this vendor to be reliable in the past
              and they can deliver to national competitions as they are usually in
              attendance as they are active in the Federation. There is
              <a class="link" href="https://www.fencer.co.za/" target="_blank">another</a> run by
              one of the clubs, they are more pricey and can take their time to
              deliver) and your best bet can sometimes be to buy with other fencers
              in a bulk order. Any equipment that can be used in international
              competition will get a lot more expensive however. Every club will
              have some way to get equipment though and if you join any they will
              help find the best options available to you. You may have to rely on
              the international travels of friends or yourself to acquire equipment
              from Europe. This is a result of shipping costs and the exchange rate
              due to a relatively weak Rand.

          A complete blade (grip wires and everything else needed included) can
          go from R1 500 all the way up to R5 000. There are two main kinds of
          blades one can buy. There are “FIE blades” (blades which can be used
          in international competition) and “non-FIE blades” (blades which can
          be used in any other setting). FIE blades last much longer and in
          general maintain their shape better than non-FIE blades. Blades will
          break depending on how often you fence and the kinds of actions you do
          while fencing. It is reasonable to expect a blade to last 6 months or
          more while fencing very regularly (4 sessions of 3 hours a week).

          over R 10 000 for FIE gear and around R 4 000 for a complete set of
          protective gear. It is recommended that one buys parts piece by piece

          All in all, fencing in South Africa can be quite expensive. Cheapest
          options are to join university clubs which will often cost less than 2
          months of membership fees for a private club for a whole year of
          membership. This is not the case for all university clubs however.

          If you want to compete and make it to the Olympics or World
          Championships, you will need to spend a lot on equipment. Your best
          bet would be to stick to epee as your competitive weapon as the pool
          of competitors is the largest (this is partially because of pentathlon
          including epee as an event, it is common to find fencers who began
          with pentathlon and specialised later). Foil has a smaller pool of
          fencers and has shown some growth, but the standard is lower compared
          to epee in terms of international results. Refereeing in foil takes a
          larger role than in epee as the right to attack is decided by the
          referee. The way the rules are applied can change a lot from year to
          year at the international level. South African referees often referee
          in the way that they did ten years ago. There are exceptions but,
          there is ultimately less infrastructure for developing foil now. Sabre
          is tiny, there are few coaches, and it is easily the country’s weakest
          weapon in terms of international results. It would be unadvisable to
          compete in it unless you REALLY want to be the biggest fish in the
          smallest pond.

          If you want to make it to the national team, there are several money
          related obstacles. Entrance fees for competitions cost +-R 400 for
          provincials. For nationals you require a national license which costs
          R 400 for each year plus the fee for the national competition which is
          an additional R 400+. The cheapest area to be situated in would be
          Gauteng. This is because national competitions take place in Gauteng,
          Limpopo, Western Cape, Eastern Cape, Free State and Kwa-Zulu Natal. To
          ensure you can get points for national rankings, you will need to
          travel to these places 3 or 4 times a year.

          To make the national team,
          you will need to be in the top 4 of epee, your age category, and your
          gender category. As of a recent South African sport governing body
          change in policy, national colours are only awarded to a smaller group
          if there are fewer competitors in that group. For example, sabre would
          only award top 1 national colours and foil maybe 3. If you are to make
          the national team and qualify for international competitions like
          African Championships (unless you qualify for funding as a previously
          disadvantaged group) you would have to pay your own way for travel,
          equipment, and accommodation. The rewards for do well in a competition
          like African Championships is a world ranking. If you secure a high
          enough world ranking you can qualify for World Championships.

          The big one, the Olympics. If you want to qualify for the Olympics,
          you must do REALLY well at international competitions or win
          the African Zonal Qualifier. The easiest way in would be to win the
          African Zonal Qualifier. This has very recently been achieved by one 
          South African men's epee fencer ahead of the Paris 2024 Olympics. Therefore, There
          will be one fencer representing South Africa at the Paris 2024 Olympics.

          Competing in fencing is more expensive than other sports in South
          Africa. It gets exponentially more expensive if you want to compete
          internationally and/or travel for nationals. Fencing at a club while 
          only competing at provincials and nationals when they come to your 
          province is an enjoyable experience and considerably less expensive.
